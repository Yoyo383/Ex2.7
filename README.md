# Ex2.7
Exercise 2.7 for school.

Apparently the code of the keyboard interrupts that I also used in 2.6 works only on linux and not on windows, and I couldn't get anything else to work :( I tried signals, threading, and other stuff, and it didn't work. I still left it here because I believe that every OS equally important :)
